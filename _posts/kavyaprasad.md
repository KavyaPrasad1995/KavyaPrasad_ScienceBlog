Welcome to my science blog. I share work at the intersection of biomedical research, data science, and product development.

## About me

I am a Translational scientist with experience in nuclear medicine, neuro-oncology, immunology, data analysis and product development.  
I enjoy turning research questions into practical tools and solutions.
